**Analysis of Women Safety in Indian Cities using Tweets
*Overview
This project aims to analyze women’s safety concerns in Indian cities by examining tweets collected from social media platforms. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), the system identifies public sentiment and visualizes safety patterns across different locations.

**Objective
To collect, process, and analyze tweets related to women’s safety, extract sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), and identify unsafe or concern-prone areas through geolocation analysis.

**Technologies Used
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries & Packages:
	•	pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
	•	numpy – Numerical operations and array handling
	•	scikit-learn – Implementation of ML algorithms
	•	nltk – Natural Language Toolkit for NLP tasks (tokenization, stemming, stop-word removal)
	•	matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization

** NLP Techniques
	•	Tokenization – Splitting text into words/tokens
	•	Stopword Removal – Eliminating common words (like “is”, “the”, “and”)
	•	Stemming/Lemmatization – Reducing words to their base form
	•	Sentiment Analysis – Determining tweet polarity (positive/negative/neutral)
  
**Working Modules
1)Data Collection & Preprocessing
	•	Tweets are collected using social media APIs.
	•	Cleaning, formatting, and organizing data for further analysis.
2)Sentiment Analysis
	•	NLP-based sentiment classification determines user attitudes and emotions toward women’s safety.
3)Geolocation Analysis
	•	Extracts geographic information from tweets.
	•	Identifies high-risk or concern-prone locations.
4)Visualization
	•	Graphs, charts, and heatmaps are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
	•	Provides intuitive and easy-to-understand visual insights.
